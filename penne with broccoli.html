<h2> <strong>Description </strong></h2>
<p> Hot Italian sausage with broccoli rabe sauteed and served over penne. You'll love this dish so much and so will your family. Every time I make it I have to double the recipe </p>
<h2> <strong> Ingredients </strong> </h2>
<ul>
    <li> 1 (16 ounce) box penne pasta </li>
    <li> 1 pound hot Italian sausage links, cut into 1-inch pieces </li>
    <li> 3 cloves garlic, minced </li>
    <li> 1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes </li>
    <li> 1 pound broccoli rabe, cut into 1 1/2-inch lengths </li>
    <li> 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese </li>
    <li> ½ cup pasta boiling water </li>
    <li> ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese </li>
    <li> salt and pepper to taste </li>
</ul>
<h2><strong> Steps to make penne with broccoli </strong></h2>
<ol>
    <li> Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the penne, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink, reserving 1/2 cup of the water. </li>
    <li> Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the sausage pieces, garlic, and red pepper flakes in the hot pan until the sausage is no longer pink on the outside, about 4 minutes. Stir in the broccoli rabe and 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese. Pour in the reserved 1/2 cup of pasta boiling water. Cover, and cook until the sausage is no longer pink in the center and the broccoli rabe is tender, 5 to 7 minutes. </li>
    <li> Stir the cooked pasta, broccoli rabe, and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese together until evenly mixed. Season to taste with salt and pepper to serve. </li>
</ol>
<h2><strong> Enjoy ! </strong></h2>
